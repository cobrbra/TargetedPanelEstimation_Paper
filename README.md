# Data-driven design of targeted gene panels for estimating immunotherapy biomarkers

Below is contained the code and LaTeX necessary to reproduce the paper. The file Code.R should run happily on a standard laptop - commented out code gives the full workflow necessary to generate all the details (with a sufficiently big computer). Where these are included, all data has been pre-loaded.

The code here is purely data analysis and figure production: the real implementation of our method is in the R package [ICBioMark](https://github.com/cobrbra/ICBioMark).

If you have questions, please feel free to [get in touch](j.r.j.bradley@sms.ed.ac.uk).
