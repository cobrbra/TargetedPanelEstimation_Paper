# Data-driven design of targeted gene panels for estimating immunotherapy biomarkers

Contained in this repository is the code and LaTeX necessary to reproduce the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04296). The file code/Code.R should run happily on a standard laptop - commented out code gives the full workflow necessary to generate all the details (with a sufficiently big computer). Where these are included, all data has been pre-loaded. The script code/Code.R should be run from the home working directory for the repository. The file analysis.sh is for use on the Eddie supercomputer.

The code here is purely data analysis and figure production: the real implementation of our method is in the R package [ICBioMark](https://github.com/cobrbra/ICBioMark).
